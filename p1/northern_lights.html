                <i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</i>, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's
                atmosphere-at alititudes from 60 to more than 250 miles-when charged particles from the
                sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show

            The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antartica. Luckily, there are
            much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best
            seats to this celestial scene, considfer anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55<sup>o</sup>
            and low light pollution. FInd your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.

            In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but
            not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field
            lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest
            autumnal equinox in Spetember, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find
            the dark hours of your locations here, or by using a sky guide app.
