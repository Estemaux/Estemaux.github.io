        <b><i> Iceland </i></b> is a beautiful country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist with each other.
        Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where the insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

       The Aurora Borealis takes its name frim the Roman Goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the
       Greek name of the Northen wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hospot
       for this magnificent lightshow. <br>
       The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred as the Northern Lights,
       is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with
       the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar
       luminous green streaks across the sky.

       When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay attention to the country's namesake-namely,
       its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-background
       and it takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svinafellsjökull
       glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik
       and Skaftafell.
